    "blurbPrompt": "Please write a poetic blurb (2 verses max) about success in the classroom from the perspective of a student with a learning disability who is studying under a teacher who uses Universal Design for Learning (UDL). The student studies in an inclusive classroom, where students can learn without being segregated or singled out due to perceived disability. The student’s performance flourished when their teacher presumed their competence (Five Moore Minutes, 2021). Their teacher followed the three core principles of UDL (Universal Design for Learning): Engagement (motivating all learners to do their best work by getting them interested, challenging them, and keeping them motivated. This is achieved by implementing classroom strategies that empower and engage students, providing choices, reducing anxiety, and rewarding effort), Representation (focuses on teaching content in an accessible way by presenting it through various modalities such as videos, websites, pictures, and realia), and Expression (offering students multiple options to demonstrate their learning, moving beyond traditional tests and papers to include methods exploiting student strengths) (Spencer, 2011). The student states explicitly their disability, how their teacher allowed for achieving success, emphasizing how inclusive education practices helped them find their own path to learning. The student should not use technical language about UDL in their blurb, however the strategic pedagogical intentions of the teacher should be inferable or implied in the blurb. Please be specific, as this inference will be run multiple times, and we desire a unique story each inference.\n\nDanforth, S. (2014). Becoming a great inclusive educator.
