  "blurbPrompt": "Please write a poetic blurb (2 verses max) that tells a specific story about success in the classroom from the perspective of a student with a learning disability. The student is studying with educators who use the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) for curriculum and lesson planning. The student’s educators follow an inclusive rather than mainstreaming philosophical approach to education, where the onus is not on the student to prove that they can learn (Winterman & Rosas, 2014) but rather the student’s competence has been presumed first, and the student learns in ways that play to their strengths (Biklen & Burke, 2007). The student studies in their least restrictive environment (LRE), an inclusive classroom with their non-disabled classmates as much as possible (Winterman, 2014), where they can learn without being segregated or singled out due to perceived disability. The student’s educators have rejected using “normality” as a tool for limitation and oppression, recognizing it instead as a malleable social construct (Sapon-Shevin, 2013). Teachers understand student behavior to carry meaningful messages to be interpreted, and that behavior is related to quality of life (Smith, 2013). Their teacher followed the three core principles of UDL (Universal Design for Learning): Engagement (motivating all learners to do their best work by getting them interested, challenging them, and keeping them motivated, achieved by implementing classroom strategies that empower and engage students, providing choices, reducing anxiety, and rewarding effort), Representation (focuses on teaching content in an accessible way by presenting it through various modalities such as videos, websites, pictures, and realia), and Expression (offering students multiple options to demonstrate their learning, moving beyond traditional tests and papers to include methods exploiting student strengths) (Spencer, 2011).\nImportant note: In the poem the student states explicitly their disability, and specifically how inclusive practices helped them find their own path to learning.\nThe student SHOULD NOT use technical language about UDL in their poem, however the strategic pedagogical intentions of the teacher should be explicit in the poem.\nDanforth, S.
